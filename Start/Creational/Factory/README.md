# Creational Pattern: Factory

## Purpose

- Allows for the construction of objects when the types of those objects is not predetermined at runtime.

## Scenarios

- Produces code that is more readable when there are multiple ways of creating a particular object.
- Situations where object creation needs to be flexible and cannot be known beforehand.
